## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me: 
🏫 I am a sophomore student at the _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_ pursuing a double major in computer science and business administration. Computer science and business have many overlapping areas, and I am excited to explore the connections between the two fields more. I am fascinated by coding because it encourages problem solving; I  As I venture through college, I hope to realize the capabilities of code to work on meaningful projects that will make a difference in peoples' lives. 

🧩 Outside of my studies, I enjoy taking pictures, playing classical piano, and playing sports with friends. I am a [photographer for The Daily Tar Heel](https://www.dailytarheel.com/staff/alex-yang) at UNC, and I love that it has challenged me to capture more moments that matter. I also like collecting trading cards and playing the New York Time Games–if you have the NYT Games mobile app, add me and let's see who can finish the Mini the fastest!

## 📖 Classes:
📝 I am currently enrolled in __COMP 211__ (Systems Fundamentals), __COMP 301__ (Foundations of Programming), and __COMP 455__ (Models of Language and Computation). In COMP 211, I am drawing connections between high-level programming languages and computer organization. In COMP 301, I am learning industry standard design patterns. In COMP 455, I am being introduced to the theory of computation. Previous courses I have taken include __COMP 210__ (Data Structures and Analysis), __COMP 290__ (Essential Tools for Computer Science) and __COMP 110__ (Introduction to Programming and Data Science). In COMP 210, I deepened my understanding of data structures like HashMaps and Heaps. I learned the time complexities of searches, insertions, and deletions in the most frequently used data structures, and can recognize the optimal data type to use in a given scenario. In COMP 290, I learned the principles of behind the command line interface, Docker, and Git, in which I've developed working proficiency in using version control systems in collaborative coding projects. In COMP 110, I learned foundational programming concepts such as data types, boolean logic, writing functions, control flow, and recursion. I am currently an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the course!

📱 I am learning iOS app development as a member of App Team Carolina's iOS Apprenticeship. We are diving into industry standard iOS development practices and enhancing our understanding on how to make professional apps.

## ⚙️ Personal Projects:

📸 I am working on an iOS app called [Booking101](https://github.com/aqyang28/f24-bootcamp-final-project). I began the app for my iOS Bootcamp final project, and I hope to continue polishing it as I learn more about creating professional apps in Apprenticeship. I am also creating a personal photography website to showcase some of my favorite shots.
