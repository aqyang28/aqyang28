## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me: 
🏫 I am a first-year student at the _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_ planning to double major in computer science and business administration. Computer science and business have many overlapping areas, and I am excited to explore the connections between the two fields more. I am fascinated by the possibilities of coding because it is such a powerful tool. As I venture through college, I hope to realize the capabilities of code to work on meaningful projects that will make a difference in peoples' lives. 

🧩 Outside of my studies, I enjoy taking pictures, playing classical piano, and playing sports with friends. I am a photographer for The Daily Tar Heel at UNC, and I love that it has challenged me to capture more moments that matter. I also like collecting trading cards and playing the New York Time Games– if you have the NYT Games mobile app, add me and let's see who can finish the Mini the fastest!

## 📖 Classes:
📝 I am currently enrolled in __COMP 210__ (Data Structures and Analysis). In COMP 210, I am learning how to optimize the data used in computer programs to maximize efficiency. Previous courses I have taken include __COMP 110__ (Introduction to Programming and Data Science) and __COMP 290__ (Essential Tools for Computer Science). In COMP 110, I learned foundational programming concepts such as data types, boolean logic, writing functions, control flow, and recursion. In COMP 290, I learned the principles of behind the command line interface, Docker, and Git. 

📱 I am also learning iOS app development as a member of App Team Carolina's iOS Apprenticeship.

## ⚙️ Personal Projects:

📸 I am working on an iOS app called [Booking101](https://github.com/aqyang28/f24-bootcamp-final-project). I began the app for my iOS Bootcamp final project, and I hope to continue polishing it as I learn more about creating professional apps in Apprenticeship. I am also creating a personal photography website to showcase some of my favorite shots.
