## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me: 
🏫 I am a freshman at the _University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill_ planning to double major in computer science and business. Computer science and business have many overlapping areas, and I am excited to explore the connections between the two fields more while studying at UNC. I am most interested in learning iOS and web development. Whether it be building a mobile game or a constructing the backend code for a company's website, I am fascinated by the possibilites of that coding holds. 

📸 Outside of my studies, I love taking pictures, practicing piano, and playing sports with friends. I am currently working with my brother to create a personal photography website to showcase some of my favorite shots and make it easier to book photo sessions with me. 

## 📖 Classes:
📝 I am currently enrolled in _COMP 110_ (Introduction to Programming and Data Science) and _COMP 290_ (Essential Tools for Computer Science). In COMP 110, I have learned foundational programming concepts such as data types, boolean logic, writing functions, control flow, and recursion. In COMP 290, I have learned the principles of behind the command line interface, Docker, and Git. 

📱 I am also learning Apple app development as a member of _App Team Carolina's_ iOS bootcamp.

## 🛠️ Tools and Programming Languages:
💻 Python, Java, SwiftUI, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

-> partipated in American Computer Science League (ACSL) hackathon in Python

-> enrolled in AP Computer Science A and created a Sudoku puzzle generator in Java

-> personal website creation using HTML, JavaScript, CSS (beginner proficiency)
